15.10.2020 v1.2 for 1.1.2b
	Thanks to piepie62's contribution there is now support for enchancement spells and visuals for both strike spell ranges and enchancement spell markers.

20.01.2022 v1.3
	Now resets the markers when entering \ restarting a stage.
	Also doesn't bind to enterFrame because we don't need to be running out-of-stage
	Updated to Bezel 1.x
	
24.01.2022 v1.4
	Updated to use Bezel's keybinds.
