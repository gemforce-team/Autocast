# Autocast

## Description
Autocast is a game modification for GCFW.

It allows you to set a virtual marker on the field (one per strike spell). Every time the respective spell's charge reaches maximum it will be automatically cast on that marker's position.


This is a time saving and QOL mod, exactly the same results can be achieved without it.


## Changelog
https://github.com/gemforce-team/Autocast/blob/master/Changelog.txt


## Known issues
* No graphics for spell position\range.
* **Markers are NOT RESET when you enter a new level!**


## Usage
* Press `Ctrl + number` to enter marker placement mode for that spell. The only indication that you've done so is a floating text message.
* Leftclick the desired point on the playing field, an invisible marker will be placed there. Again, you'll receive confirmation vie a floating text message.
* From that point on the respective strike spell will be cast on that position every time it reaches max charge. (Cast attempts happen every 15 frames)
* To remove a marker, enter marker placement mode with `Ctrl + number`, then rightclick.
* **Please not that at the moment markers are not reset when you enter a new level, you'll have to (re)move them individually**
